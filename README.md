# Multilingual Text Translation Using MarianMT Model
The project incorporates the MarianMTModel from the Transformers library, a state-of-the art model designed for machine translation tasks. 
This model utilizes an encoder-decoderarchitecture with attention mechanisms to generate accurate translations between different languages.
The code follows a series of steps to facilitate text translation. It begins by prompting the user to input the source language, target language, and the text to be translated. 
It then tokenizes the input text and utilizes the pre-trained MarianMTModel to generate the translation. 
Finally, the translated text is decoded and presented to the user, ensuring a seamless translation experience.
Through this process, the program demonstrates the power of advanced generative AI in overcoming language barriers and facilitating effective cross-cultural communication. 
By leveraging the capabilities of the MarianMTModel, the code provides users with a reliable and efficient solution for translating text between diverse languages.
